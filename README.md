Simplistic landing page template for a Minecraft server. Mildly responsive.
Has IP field which copies when clicked.


# Information on Updates, Issues, and Pull Requests:

This project was made with the following thoughts and goals in mind:

 - Build a basic landing page in under an hour.
 - Use as little code as possible.
 - Provide at least basic responsive capabilities.
 - Provide a simple open source landing page which can be easily modified for use anywhere.
 
The limitations imposed by these goals mean updates will be sparse and Issues and Pull Requests will be handled eventually. No major changes will be made to this repo except to add additional responsiveness, documentation, or to fix bugs.
